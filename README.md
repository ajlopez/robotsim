Robot simulation, WIP

## Installation

Via npm on Node:

```
npm install robotsim
```

## Objetives

### Environment

- Have a two-dimension environment
- Have light sources in environment
- Have obstables in environment (initially, simple rectangles)

### Robot

- One or more robots
- Distance sensors, with orientation
- Light sensors, with orientation
- Movement actions (ie: two wheels, or only advance distance and turn)
- Sensors with noise
- Action actuators (ie: wheels) with noise (ie: wheel slip)

### Strategies

- Hardwired programming
- Evolutionary programming

### Interface
